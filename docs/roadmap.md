# Project Roadmap 🛣️

This document outlines the development path for **AI-Trucking**, moving from a digital prototype toward real-world pilots.  
Each stage builds on the previous one, ensuring safety, feasibility, and responsible AI integration.

---

## 📌 Phase 1: Digital Prototype (✅ Current Stage)
- System diagrams, dashboard mockups, and one-pager  
- AI-in-the-loop workflow (operator always in control)  
- OpenAI API usage plan (GPT for routing, Whisper for voice commands)  
- Evaluation of feasibility and safety constraints  

**Deliverables:**  
- Documentation (this repo)  
- Dashboard mockup PNG/PDF  
- One-pager for pitching  

---

## 📌 Phase 2: Simulation Environment
- Use **CARLA** or **Unity** to simulate trucks, routes, and risks  
- Integrate GPT for **risk-aware routing advice** inside simulation  
- Integrate Whisper for **voice command intent mapping**  
- Create **operator dashboard prototype** connected to simulation data  

**Deliverables:**  
- Demo video of AI-in-loop simulation  
- Operator workflow tested in sandbox  
- Sample JSON plans + logs  

---

## 📌 Phase 3: Small-Scale Pilot
- Partner with logistics operators or universities  
- Use controlled environments (e.g., test track with small trucks/rovers)  
- Connect simulation to **satellite-like comms layer** (emulated if real sat not available)  
- Validate safety, operator workflows, and real-time AI advice  

**Deliverables:**  
- Pilot report with performance metrics  
- Risk evaluation under real-world conditions  
- Updated safety guidelines  

---

## 📌 Phase 4: Industry-Grade Expansion
- Integrate with **fleet management systems**  
- Harden cybersecurity (end-to-end encryption, intrusion detection)  
- Expand to larger fleets and riskier regions  
- Begin certification process for compliance with safety and transport regulations  

**Deliverables:**  
- Enterprise-ready operator dashboard  
- Secure backend infrastructure  
- Compliance documentation  

---

## 📌 Phase 5: Long-Term Vision 🌍
- Full **AI-assisted logistics ecosystem**  
- Satellite + AI orchestration across multiple regions  
- Multi-modal integration (trucks, ships, trains)  
- Global partnerships to secure high-risk supply chains  

---

## 🎯 Roadmap Summary
- **Now → Prototype docs/mockups**  
- **Next → Simulation (safe, low-cost, scalable)**  
- **Later → Pilot + Industry adoption**  

AI-Trucking grows from a **concept demo** into a **life-saving logistics solution** that keeps goods moving while protecting people.
