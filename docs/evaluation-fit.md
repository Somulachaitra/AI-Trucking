## Problem Relevance
Dangerous trucking due to climate and robbery is a real problem that affects drivers, logistics firms, and supply chains. This project keeps people out of harm while maintaining deliveries.

## Idea Feasibility
We demonstrate the concept with diagrams, a dashboard mockup, and a clear AI-in-the-loop workflow. It is realistic for a student team to build and iterate digitally without hardware.

## Use of OpenAI APIs
GPT provides risk-aware routing advice in JSON; Whisper enables hands-free emergency commands. The APIs are used thoughtfully as decision support, not as direct actuators.
