# AI-Trucking
A satellite-supervised, AI-assisted trucking system that keeps drivers out of danger by enabling remote monitoring, safe rerouting, and tele-operation during climate or security risks.

# Satellite-Controlled Self-Driving Truck (Digital Prototype)

**What it is**  
A satellite-supervised, AI-assisted trucking system that keeps drivers out of danger by enabling remote monitoring, safe rerouting, and tele-operation during climate or security risks.

**Why it matters**  
In many regions, trucking is dangerous due to extreme weather and robbery. Our prototype shows how AI + satellite oversight can keep supply chains moving while protecting people.

**What this repo contains**  
- Diagrams of the system architecture and the end-to-end operations flow.  
- A clickable mockup of the Remote Operations Dashboard.  
- Documentation of how GPT and Whisper would be used in the system.

**Status**  
Digital prototype only (slides + mockups). No hardware required.

**Folders**  
- `design/` exported images and the one-pager  
- `docs/` evaluation notes and OpenAI API plan
