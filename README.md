*Smart Fleet Optimization Using AI*

![Banner](design/system-diagram.png)

## 📌 Overview

AI-Trucking is a project that explores how **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** can improve the efficiency of trucking and logistics.
The goal is to **reduce costs, optimize routes, and improve fuel efficiency** while making transportation smarter and more sustainable.

This project was built as part of my **B.Tech (2nd Year)** journey, combining my learnings in **AI, system design, and software engineering practices**.

---

## ✨ Features

* 📍 **Route Optimization** – Suggests the best routes using AI.
* ⛽ **Fuel Efficiency Insights** – Tracks consumption and gives suggestions to save fuel.
* 🛠️ **System Architecture** – Designed with modular components (data, AI models, visualization).
* 📊 **Visualization** – Easy-to-read dashboards and evaluation metrics.
* 📄 **Documentation** – Includes one-pager, system architecture diagrams, and usage guides.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

Here’s how the system works:

![System Architecture](design/system-architecture.png)

* **Data Layer** → Stores trip & fuel data.
* **AI Engine** → Runs optimization and predictions.
* **Visualization** → Displays results in dashboards.
* **User Interface** → Simple interface for interactions.
